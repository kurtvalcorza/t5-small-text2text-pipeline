        "`google-t5/t5-small` is the original 60 M-parameter T5 of Raffel et al. (2020) — **not FLAN-T5**, so it follows "
        "only the task prefixes it was trained on, not free-form instructions. At inference the encoder reads the whole "
        "prefixed input once and the decoder emits one SentencePiece token per step until `</s>` or a step ceiling; "
        "**greedy decoding** (per-step argmax, `num_beams=1`, `do_sample=False`) is the default decision rule and beam "
        "search is available on request — there is no sampling and no seed. The caller writes the task prefix — "
        "`summarize: `, `translate English to German: `, `translate English to French: ` or `translate English to "
        "Romanian: ` — in front of the text: **the pipeline invents no prefix** and only reports which known one an "
        "input started with (`known_prefix`, or `None`). **No adaptation occurs:** no training, fine-tuning, in-context "
        "conditioning, or preprocessing fitting — the pinned checkpoint is used as published. What the upstream "
        "checkpoint supplies is the model, the SentencePiece tokenizer and the prefix convention; what the carried "

It carries no reference outputs, so any number it produces is smoke/sanity evidence, never a quality measurement. Optional BYOD upload is gated off by default so the sample path can run top-to-bottom without interaction; each non-empty line is one input that must already start with its task prefix.

        "The generated strings are the model's continuation of *your* prefixed input under greedy (or beam) decoding: "
        "fluent text that can add, drop or invert a fact, and the pipeline attaches no probability, confidence or "
        "quality score to it — `generated_tokens`, `input_tokens` and `stopped_by` are counts and flags, not evidence of "
        "correctness. On the synthetic sample the checks prove only that the input contract, the prefix convention, the "
        "verified snapshot load and the generation path work end to end; the evaluation report is `not-measurable` "
        "because none can be computed without reference outputs, and a real evaluation needs referenced inputs from your "
        "own domain, a ROUGE/BLEU-style scorer, and enough items to state a dispersion. An unknown prefix produces "
        "plausible-looking output rather than an error; inputs above `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` are refused rather than cut; "
        "outputs that stop at `max_new_tokens` are truncated mid-thought. The pipeline exposes no instruction following, "
        "sampling, batching, or the upstream `task_specific_params` decoding settings. Decoding is deterministic on a "
        "fixed device and dtype, but CPU and CUDA float32 kernels can diverge on a near-tied token.\n\n"
        "Successful execution proves that the recorded repository revision's pipeline module, carried in this notebook, "
        "can acquire and digest-verify the pinned model snapshot, validate the demonstrated inputs against the enforced "
        "ceilings, execute the public pipeline path, and emit the shown machine-readable outputs in the tested runtime — "
        "without the repository being reachable. It does **not** establish benchmark superiority, summarisation or "
        "translation quality on any domain, a usable acceptance threshold, safety for high-consequence decisions, or "
        "production fitness on an unseen domain.\n\n"
        "**Troubleshooting.** `RuntimeError: Core dependencies changed while older modules were loaded` in Section 1: "
        "the pinned install replaced a package the runtime had pre-imported — restart the runtime and rerun from the "
        "top. `FileNotFoundError: snapshot file missing` or a `sha256`/`size` `ValueError` in Section 3: a staged file is "
        "incomplete or altered — delete it from `weights/{MODEL_KEY}/` and rerun Section 3. `ValueError: input is N "
        "tokens; ceiling is MAX_INPUT_TOKENS=512` in Section 6: split or shorten that BYOD line and rerun from "
        "Section 4. `stopped_by` equal to `max_new_tokens`: raise `GEN_MAX_NEW_TOKENS` (ceiling `MAX_NEW_TOKENS`) and "
        "rerun Section 6. Output that copies the input: the line has no trained prefix, or the passage is too short to "
        "summarise.\n\n"
        "**Next experiments.** Set `NUM_BEAMS = 4` and compare the beam-search outputs with the greedy ones (the "
        "card-pass smoke found the short translation unchanged); translate the same sentence with the French and "
        "Romanian prefixes; hand the `summarize: ` input a passage you wrote a one-sentence reference summary for and "
        "score the output with a ROUGE implementation of your choice — the first step towards the real evaluation the "
        "report asks for; run the same batch on a CUDA runtime and diff the outputs against the CPU run. None of these "
        "turns the sample result into evidence of production fitness.\n\n"
