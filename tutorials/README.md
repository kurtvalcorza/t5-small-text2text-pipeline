Notebook specification: **DIMER Notebook Specification 1.0**

| Notebook | Profile | Capability | Default runtime | BYOD | Release status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `t5_small_text2text_colab.ipynb` | `TASK-INFERENCE` | caller-prefixed text-to-text generation (summarisation, En→De/Fr/Ro translation) with `google-t5/t5-small` (original T5, not FLAN); greedy decoding by default, beam search on request, no sampling; `generated_tokens`/`input_tokens`/`stopped_by`/`known_prefix` per call; no metric (ROUGE/BLEU need references the sample lacks) | CPU (CUDA used automatically when available) | one UTF-8 text file, one already-prefixed input per line, gated off by default; no references, so no metric | **Candidate** — static checks pass; the clean-runtime execution run is pending and will be recorded in `../docs/release-verification.md`, which must be reviewed for the exact notebook revision before promotion |

## Conformance notes

- The notebook exercises `T5SmallText2TextPipeline` from the repository public API rather than reimplementing model loading; model acquisition goes through the package: `stage_missing_files(WEIGHTS_DIR, allow_download=True)` fetches only the manifest entries a fresh clone lacks (the git-ignored `model.safetensors`), at the pinned revision, `verify_snapshot` re-hashes every entry, and `from_pretrained(weights_dir=WEIGHTS_DIR)` loads the verified files (`local_files_only=True`, `trust_remote_code=False`); the notebook never calls `huggingface_hub` or `transformers` directly.
- The default sample is synthetic: two already-prefixed inputs authored in code (the card-pass smoke's `translate English to German: The house is wonderful.` and a four-sentence `summarize: ` passage); the pipeline invents no prefix and the notebook says so. The sample has no reference outputs, so no ROUGE/BLEU is computed and none is manufactured; the sanity checks are plumbing checks only.
- Decision rule and score semantics: greedy per-step argmax (`num_beams=1`, `do_sample=False`) stated as the default, beam search as the alternative; the pipeline emits no probability or confidence and ships no acceptance threshold — the caller owns it. `stopped_by == 'max_new_tokens'` is explained as a truncated output.
- Ceilings `MAX_TEXT_CHARS` (20000), `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` (512, rejected not truncated), `MAX_NEW_TOKENS` (512), `MAX_NUM_BEAMS` (8), `DEFAULT_MAX_NEW_TOKENS` (64), `DECISION_RULE` and `TASK_PREFIXES` are printed before the model runs; instruction following, sampling, batching, other language pairs and the upstream `task_specific_params` are named as out of scope.
- CPU is documented as adequate with the card-measured smoke numbers (3.89 s load + verify, 0.16 s / 0.31 s per call on an Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX).
- `USE_BYOD` defaults to `False` so the sample path never opens an upload dialog.
- `tools/validate_release_assets.py` performs source validation only. It does not satisfy the
  clean-runtime execution requirement; a release review must confirm that a recorded clean run in
  `docs/release-verification.md` matches the notebook revision under review before the status is
  promoted to `Release-grade`.
